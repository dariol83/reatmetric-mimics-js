# How to run the examples
This folder contains some SVG files and some examples that demonstrate how to use the ReatMetric Mimics JS library.

In order to run the examples here, you need a web server. A very simple one is the one embedded in MobaXTerm.

Copy all the files here inside a folder, and configure the web server so that it serves the folder as its root.
In the examples, the SVG resources are always loaded using the address http://127.0.0.1:18001/<resource>.svg, hence on port 18001.

Copy the rtmt-library.js file to the same folder.

Launch the web server, open one HTML page and check the example.
